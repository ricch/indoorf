We made it to Friday which feels like it deserves a PARADE, this week especially. I’m not sure what is going on (maybe the fact that I have a small team of children), but MAN the weeks are feeling LONG and wild over here! Can it be “summer” forever, but with all the seasons??!

Bringing you a few of my favorite things this FRIDAY!! 

THESE BOOTS we just bought Winnie - we’re all obsessed. SO cute! 

Have you guys used the Slidebox app? It’s seriously so cool - makes it super quick and easy to sort/delete photos. I’m working through my albums so I can make photo books for the kids (my goal is to do one for each year of their lives.. I’m way behind so don’t ask me how it’s going.) 

My favorite Free People sweater is BACK and I have 5 colors but I’m thinking I need this one to add to my collection. (this is also AMAZING for maternity!)

We’re slowly selling the kids’ clothes as we grow out of it - join Kidizen here and search #bkforkh to find all my listings!! You’ll get $5 off your first order! YAASSS! 

Finally, it’s FALL and I’m sharing TONS of good oily diffuser blends, etc on  my IG page, so if you’re curious and want ALL. THE. FALL. in your life, come hang! 

Next week I’m sharing a fun playlist to keep your morning HAPPY and some of our new favorite fall books that we added to the collection this year!
