Succulents are known for their resilience, and they make great plant babies for beginner indoor gardeners. They survive (and even thrive!) through hardships, but some plants struggle to make it through the winter.

Most cactus parents see their succulents wither and die during colder months, which can be discouraging and frustrating. It might be a surprise to know that your cacti probably died due to too much attention rather than negligence. If you’ve experienced cactus death in the past, you know how unfriendly the winter can be on your little friends.

## Location: Give Your Cactus a Happy Home in Your Home

The harshness of winter depends on where you live, but the first step for cactus care in any colder climate is to bring your succulents inside.

Then, you need to find the right place. Give them as much sun as possible by placing them near a south- or east-facing window. But beware. Putting your cacti too close to a window could expose them to chilly and unpleasant drafts.

Rotate your plants every so often to give them even light exposure, especially if you have a group of succulents together.

## Water: Don’t Drown Your Plant Baby

Don’t overwater your cacti! This is especially important in the winter.

You want to give your cactus _just enough_ water. That means a teeny tiny sprinkle of water once in a while to dampen the soil and prevent them from withering into nothingness.

Cacti are especially prone to root rot, so letting their soil dry out between watering is essential. Your plant might have root rot if it has discolored or dotted skin. Oozing liquid is another sign of rot.

Root rot isn’t a nice look, so once the winter solstice hits around the end of December, start giving your cacti less water than usual.

## Fertilizer: Overfeeding is Like Overeating, Don’t Do It!

During the winter months, your cactus is dormant. Think of it like a plant nap. It doesn’t need much water or much food. It’s recommended to hold off on feeding your cacti until winter is completely over.

Don’t worry, you won’t starve your plant.

## Indoor Cactus Gardening: Proper Winter Choices

If you’re looking to buy a new cactus this winter, do your research ahead of time, and prepare where they’ll be happy.

Some succulents survive better than others in colder climates, like prickly pear cacti, also known as Opuntia, which can survive harsh winters.
