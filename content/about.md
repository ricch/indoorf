# Helping The World Grow Indoor Gardens

![Comparison of Artificial Intelligence vs Human Intelligence](/uploads/IF_about.png)

Hello there! My name is Kevin Moran, I’m a communication designer and indoor gardening from Toronto, Canada. As a freelance artist, I’ve spent many long days and late nights indoors staring at my computer living trading attention between tasks and job opportunities. My passion for design initially drove me to fill my office with foliage to make it more optically pleasing with a green aesthetic… but as life got busier and my indoor garden grew, I found it was a great way to schedule therapeutic time for myself and live a healthier life. My growing knowledge of plants has driven me to challenge myself with tougher plants within harsher Candian conditions. 

I’ve learned a lot since killing my first Blue Star Succulent (RIP Jeffery), and I’d like to share what I’ve learned over the years. Marrying my graphic communication skills and my knowledge of indoor plant life to provide helpful resources to new (and old) green thumbers solve common (and not so common) plant problems.

I’m a firm believer that everyone should bring the outdoors inside. Not only to spruce up the look of your space, but also improve your indoor air quality, reduce stress, increase productivity and live healthier. So good luck, and get growing!
