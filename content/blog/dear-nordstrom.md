It’s a good thing I have 5 kids and very little time to dink around on my computer, because my online shopping habit could become a real addiction while we’re on this lovely quarantine. 

However, our friends at Nordstrom are opportunists (or servants - you decide!) and threw us a bone with a 25% off sale. So naturally, I had to take advantage (they aren’t the only opportunists out there ;)

I grabbed a few things that the kids needed and am also showing you guys some of my very favorite things that are on sale right now (that rarely go on sale!!!)  

Keeping this simple - links are all below!
