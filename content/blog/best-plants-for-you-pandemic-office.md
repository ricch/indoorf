How about a Friday favorites to kick us into the holiday weekend?! 

I’ve been v. v. busy on pinterest lately, and have always add a strange obsession with pretty quotes. So here’s my inspiration board if you’re bored ;) 

We’ve made our FAIR SHARE of cookies during quarantine and I honestly can say I have MASTERED this recipe, so if you’re looking for a GEM, this is it! 

Anthropologie just re-opened here and I ran in today to grab a few things and am seriously obsessed with some of their dishes right now. My two favs: here & here. 

And last but not least, you guys know my obsession with free people sets. Well this one is the PERFECT cozy bonfire summer beach day drinking perfection set (how’s that!?) and I haven’t stopped wearing it. 

I hope you have the very best weekend with friends and fam! We’ve got tons of fun happening in our wellness community this month, so come hang out, too!
