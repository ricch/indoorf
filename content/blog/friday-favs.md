It’s been a HOT minute since I’ve showed my face over here and I can finally say we are back in the routine of things. Fall has shown up WAY faster than expected, and I feel like we were literally still waiting for summer to show up when all of a sudden people are drinking PSLS and buying sweaters!? It’s like the twilight zone. 

Now that life is back in the reality of school and work and ya know, responsibility (#longlivesummer), I will be hanging out here more often! Bellamy and Baylor are in Kinder and 1st grade, which make me feel old AF, and Winnie, Norah, Memphis and I are just spending our days doing basic mom things like walking the aisles of Target buying things we don’t need, stopping at the Starbucks drive-thru (have you tried the cold brew with pumpkin sweet cream?! OMG.) and even running into Nordstrom for rainboots if we’re feeling extra ballsy. 

I’m working on finding my rhythm as a sports mom (we’ve got dance, tennis, and soccer happening) and all I know is this: I’ve got a LONG way to go (read: failing miserably). If I can get everyone in the car without sweating and cussing and yelling, it’s a win. Snacks? Above my pay grade still. And this week at soccer, Norah decided that since we were on grass, she’d disrobe herself and pee on the sidelines. Also, Winnie got her foot stuck under the door at tennis and lost a toenail and Norah got lost in the club … (are you even a mom if you haven’t lost a kid for a minute?) All in all, we’re thriving. 

SO maybe you’re thinking “i’d spend more time getting your shit together and less time blogging”, I appreciate your concern. But not, we’re going to do ike we always do - embrace the chaos, add a couple more things to our plate (because life wasn’t designed to be boring!) and share the journey with you (the good, the bad, and the ugly!!). 

In short… I’M BACK, BITCHES!!
