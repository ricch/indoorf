“How often should I water my house plants?” is the question asked by all beginners when growing their indoor garden. The correct answer is “That depends...” is not so satisfying as some rule-of-thumb reply like “once a week” might be. But it’s the only true answer / accurate reply.

Your home during the winter may be almost as dry as a desert, and your plants will need far more water than during humid summer weather. Small pots dry out more rapidly than big ones, so must be watered more frequently. Plants in bloom need much more water than at other times.

But, in general, variations and water needs vary from plant to plant. Except for cactus and succulents, which can tolerate drouth, all other plants grows best in moistened soil.

Add water whenever top soil feels dry to the touch–whether this is weekly or even daily. When you water, do a thorough job. Supply enough moisten soil all the way to the bottom of the plant. Wait for water again until the topsoil is once more on the dry side.

## Top versus bottom watering

There are a number of satisfactory ways of watering your plants. The two most effective processes are through top or bottom watering. If you water from the top, be sure that your pot has drainage holes or pebbles or other loose material at the bottom for proper drainage.

If you water from the bottom, don’t use any drainage material. Instead, insert a wick (perferebly of fiberglass) to absorb water from the dish dlow, keep the soil uniformly moist. Or you can purchase a self watering pot from a variety of online sources like ETSY or Amazon.

Weather you water from the top of the bottom, it’s good practice to five your plants an occasional “dunking”.. Place the pot in a pail or dish of water so it is half submerged. Leave it there until the surface of the solid is moist. Set the plant aside and drain off surplus water before returning it to its usual location.

Don’t leave you a pot standing in water more than an hour or so. Too much water over a long period prevents oxygen from getting to roots, and roots need oxygen to live.

## Feeding

A little plant food goes a long way–too much might burn the roots and murder your plant. Each fertilizer brand on the market differs in strength, so be sure to follow the directions carefully.

Older plants benefit from a light feeding every two or three months, except during the winter months, when it’s best to pull back completely. New plants obtained from your local nursery need no fertilizer for the first six weeks after you get them, or even longer.

Commercial fertilizer always tell on the package the portions of nutrients they contain. Those usually present are nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potassium. When you see the figures 5-10-5 or 10-6-4, it is to the percentages of these elements, and in the order stated above.

## When Should I Feed?

It’s not best to assume that any sad looking plants will benefit from a dose of plant food. The plant is more apt to be ailing because of too much water, too little light, too dry an environment, or poor quality of the potting soil.

If your plant is suffering from starvation, nitrogen is most likely to be what it lacks. Symptoms are yellowing of new leaves, and lack of vigor in new growth.

However, symptoms of injury from too much water, too little light are similar, except that when one of these is the culprit, you usually find lower leaves turning yellow, while those higher up stay green.

Dry plant food come in powder, grainy or cubic tablet form. Or you can buy plant food as liquid. Experiment with various types to see which five you the best results.

When you use dry food, be careful not to get it onto the plant and to water it into the spoil at once. Tablets may be inserted into the soil at the outer edge of the pot, and will gradually be absorbed in the course of successive watering.

The main thing to remember when fertilizing is “Don’t overfeed.. This isn’t a buffet”!
