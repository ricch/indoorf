I’m sure we’ve all seen them. Whether it’s on your Instagram feed, laid out in a park, or at a hipster coffee shop you frequent, they intrigue us with their vintage and rugged feel. No, we aren’t talking about hippies, but we are talking about a thing that hippies own- terracotta planters! Today we’ll talk about why you should join the hippies and by your own terracotta planter. There are many advantages (and a few disadvantages) associated with these pots that are both aesthetic and functional in use.

## Advantages of Owning a Terracotta Planter

1. **They’re Natural.** Our first pro for these planters is that they not only look natural, they are natural. Terracotta in Italian literally means ‘baked earth’. The name is fitting since it is quite literally a baked clay that comes from the ground.
2. **They’re Accessible.** They are very inexpensive and can be found in any nursery or hardware store. Unlike expensive pottery planters, terracotta planters are inexpensive, but functional in use.
3. **They Allow for Great Air Flow.** They’re made of a porous material that allows air to flow through the clay and into the soil. This water and oxygen exchange can prevent root rot and other soil related diseases that could harm your green babies.
4. **They Have an Aesthetic Look.** These clay planters often look weathered and antiqued due to the mineral deposits pulled through the walls. This may result in fuzz, which is completely harmless and can be scrubbed away with dish soap and a run of the mill sponge. Or if you’re interested in getting the aged look sooner, they are a variety of salt options available online.

## Cons *A Small List*

1. First off, we know they’re great for drainage and soil aeration. However, they go a bit overboard with their large drainage hole. Be sure that you have you plant in a spot that’s okay if a small mess is left. Even if you drain your plant in the sink, extra water may drip out hours after. While we’re talking about drainage, it’s fair to mention that these planters can dry your soil out much quicker than your standard nursery pot.
2. Considered a con for most people, these pots tend to age quick easily. They pull minerals and salt deposits from your water and leave it outside the pot. This fuzz is harmless and can be scrubbed away with vinegar or standard dish soap and an average ol’ sponge. However, some see this as a pro and want to speed up this ageing process, as mentioned earlier.
3. Last but not least, their classic yet rugged look might not fit with everyone’s modern-looking interior style. So, if you really want to try them out but you fear it may throw off the design of your space, you can paint them to fit your vibe.
