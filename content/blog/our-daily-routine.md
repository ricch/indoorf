Well friends, we’re living in STRANGE times! But one of the things we always tell our kids is to focus on controlling what you can control. 

I’m pretty spontaneous in terms of my day-to-day life but having 5 kids home for the next 6 weeks is forcing my hand at a little routine around here. The kids thrive on a schedule and boundaries and I’m trying to set us all up for success! 

Collin and I sat down with the kids and came up with a daily schedule that will keep us all learning and focused in these bizarre times we’re in and I thought I’d share it with you guys in case you might be able to use it too!

We printed these out, laminated them (here’s our favorite one — we use it on ALLTHETHINGS!), and the kids LOVE to cross off their list throughout the day (we use these dry erase markers!)
